# R Lessons

The datasets used can be found [here](Data/). There are some slides related to these topics; these can be found in the slides for the main sessions [here](../Slides/). The code for each session is as follows:

* Introduction to R {[code](Code/practice_day1.R)} 
* Basic Commands in R {[code_1](Code/practice.R)} {[code_2](Code/practice_day2.R)}
* Data Preparation (self-guided {[pdf](worksheet1.pdf)} {[html](worksheet1.html)} {[solutions](worksheet1_sol.html)})
* Exploratory Analysis (self-guided {[pdf](worksheet2.pdf)} {[html](worksheet2.html)} {[solutions](worksheet2_sol.html)}) 
* Tidyverse {[code](Code/tidyverse.R)}
* Visualization & Plotting with ggplot2 {[code](Code/plots.R)}
* Mapping {[code](Code/mapping.R)}
* Time Series & Forecasting {[code](Code/forecasting.R)}

You will need to install the following packages:
- colorist, RColorBrewer, haven, xlsx, tidyverse, reshape2, ggplot2, datasets, sf, maps, data.table, viridis, scales, forecast, surveillance, slider, feasts
- *install.packages(c("colorist", "RColorBrewer", "haven", "xlsx", "tidyverse", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "datasets", "sf", "maps", "data.table", "viridis", "scales", "forecast", "surveillance", "slider", "feasts"))*

# R References

R can be a challenge to learn, especially if you've never worked in any programming languages in the past. I've placed some references [here](References/) and below to help you practice and some cheat sheets to help you remember bits of code.

## Visualization

* [Tips for Data Visualization](References): general principles
* [Color Names in R](References/Rcolor.pdf): referencing colors in R
* [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/): choosing the correct visualization
* [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/): compendium of figures and accompanying code
* [ggplot Reference Guide](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): nice cheatsheets on opening page

## Handbooks & Texts

* [The Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://appliedepi.org/epirhandbook/): nearly everything an epidemiologist might want to do in R
* [Forecasting Principles & Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/intro.html): an excellent resource to learn more about forecasting theory with code
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): data manipulation, simple models, and visualization in tidyverse
